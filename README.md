This repository contains the Truely Collectables storefront and TCOS admin system.

Start with the operator manual:

- [TCOS Operator Manual](docs/TCOS_OPERATOR_MANUAL.md)
- [TCOS Operator Manual PDF](docs/TCOS_OPERATOR_MANUAL.pdf)
- [Production Deploy Runbook](docs/PRODUCTION_DEPLOY_RUNBOOK.md)

The manual explains daily store operation, inventory, orders, offers, eBay sync, AI descriptions, sales comps, suggested pricing, and required environment variables.

When the mobile app is built, maintain its operator manual and downloadable PDF separately from the main TCOS web manual while keeping shared policies consistent.

Customer legal page:

- [Terms of Service](src/app/terms/page.tsx)
- [Seller Terms of Service](src/app/seller-terms/page.tsx)

To regenerate the downloadable manual PDF:

```bash
npm run manual:pdf
```

## Production deploy and smoke

Use the production runbook when shipping queued launch work:

```bash
npm run launch:production
```

The launch helper deploys production and then runs the production smoke if the deploy succeeds. The deploy step verifies Git state, handles the clean Vercel production alias, removes the unwanted `tt3b` alias if it appears, and reports Vercel quota blocks clearly.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
